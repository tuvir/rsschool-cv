## About me

I'm a fourth-year college student. I'm interested in front-end development because allows me to use my artistic vision and passion for programming at the same time. I like to build my own projects and study new techniques on the go. Being a developer means to continously learn new things and I like to learn very much!

## Skills

- HTML5, CSS3
- Responsive design
- JavaScript

**Code example:**

```
function hasChar(word, letter) {
  let result = false;
  for(let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {

      result = true;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
